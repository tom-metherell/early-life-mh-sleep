Script in series: "Associations between early life mental health indicators and sleep in adulthood"

This script is a na√Øve R implementation of Danielle Bodicoat's (07/10/2015) Stata do-file implementing Winkler et al.'s (2016) algorithm for deriving sleep time from raw ActivPAL event files.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Dependencies
We start by loading the necessary dependencies.

```{r dependencies}
library(parallel)
library(purrr)
library(data.table)
```

## Splitting data
Because this algorithm is computationally intensive, we will use parallel computation to speed up the process. To do this we need to divide up the participants into as many groups as there are cores available for use.

```{r split}
# Setting random seed
set.seed(3154)

# Creating a list of event files
filelist <- list.files(path = ".\\Events_EventMarker", pattern = "Events.csv")

# Generating a random integer between 1 and the number of cores available for each participant, then creating a data frame of them
node <- sample(1:detectCores(), length(filelist), replace = TRUE)
assignments <- data.frame(1:length(node), node)

# Splitting the file list according to the random number assigned
for(i in 1:detectCores()){
  assign(
    paste0("filelist", i),
    filelist[assignments$node == i]
  )
}

# Removing unnecessary objects
rm(list = c("filelist", "node", "assignments", "i"))
```

## The algorithm
We can now implement the Winkler et al. (2016) algorithm as detailed below. The program iterates through participants and successively appends the results to a .csv file; make sure no .csv file of the same name already exists before running!

```{r processing}
# Establishing parallel computation cluster
## NB: THIS SECTION IS CURRENTLY SET TO CREATE AS MANY NODES AS THERE ARE CPU CORES AVAILABLE. THIS MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS IF THERE ARE OTHER TASKS RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY
### if you need to reduce the number, substitute `detectCores()` with e.g. `detectCores() - 2` or `6` in BOTH of the appearances below AND the one above in the data splitting section

## Combining and saving data
Finally, we can combine the parallel data frames to produce a single complete data frame, and write this to a .csv file.

```{r write}
# Binding data frames together
df <- reduce(mget(ls(pattern = "df")), rbind)

# Writing combined data frame to .csv file
fwrite(df, "winkler_sleep.csv")
```
